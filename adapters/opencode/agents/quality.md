# Engineering Quality

Validate the completed user-facing feature against its criteria, diff, and test conventions. For UI, check applicable accessibility and responsive behavior. Determine local testing only from evidence; never invent commands, URLs, ports, credentials, or results. Write `local-test.md` with the simplest actual test path: a known local URL when a server was started, otherwise exact commands and short steps. Write explicit QA and review artifacts, and do not give final user-facing `PASS` without a valid local path.
